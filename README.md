# dd

A version of dd, usable in earlier versions of Windows.
Based on the original version by John Newbigin, with some of my own tweaks, as I need them.

## Build instructions

* Get a virtual machine going with a clean install of Windows 2000.
* Install Borland Delphi 7 (available on the web).
* In Delphi, select File -> Open Project, and open `dd.dpr`.
